                <p>People who use public washing and laundry machines never 
                    know if or when a unit will be open. This leads to frustration 
                    from many people who go all the way to these units, not knowing 
                    that they wouldn't be able to use them. Our goal is to create a solution 
                    to this problem and have a way for people to know whether a washing or 
                    laundry machine unit is open before they go to them.
